          <p>Lost &amp; Found was built for people who move through pressure with purpose. We were drawn to silhouettes that carry strength, to pieces that allow identity without noise, and to design that feels intentional at every angle.</p>
          <p>Before being found, there is always a phase of being lost. Our collections honor that transition with streetwear and gymwear made for self-expression, discipline, and individuality.</p>
